            <div class="description">
                I was lucky that my 8th-grade math teacher, Mr. Ip, majored in Computer Science and was the one who advocated my CS endeavors. In school, we had deep conversations about taking part in robotics in high school, and also the depth of programming. He was the one who introduced all sorts of languages to me: Ruby, Java, Lua, Rust. I've never heard of many of them before, and they fascinated me. I followed his advice as I entered high school, and was even luckier that my high school provided CS courses and plenty of electives including Software Development, Systems Programming, and Cybersecurity. I knew many cousins who never had these opportunities when they were in high school, leading me to create this program with Simon to help everyone begin their CS journeys.

                I have always been passionate about computer science and the endless possibilities it offers. As a child, I was fascinated by the way computers worked and I spent hours learning about different programming languages and technologies. However, my passion for computer science extended beyond just my personal interests. As a tutor at Booker T Washington Middle School, I witnessed firsthand the inequalities in education and the lack of resources available to some students. I wanted to do something to help bridge this gap and provide equal opportunities for all students to learn and grow. That's why I decided to create Pyprep with Donald, a platform that provides accessible programming education to underprivileged students. I believe that with the right resources and support, any student can succeed in the field of computer science and I am dedicated to making that happen through Pyprep.

                I'm actually intending to major in chemical/biological engineering. Even though though I'm interested in a different field of study, I know the importance of comp sci. I took AP Computer Science in my high school junior year, and the problem-solving aspect of the course really stuck with me. In the future, I'm certain I will use aspects of CS in my work and I hope to help anyone else who aren't majoring in CS obtain a versatile tool for their endeavors.
